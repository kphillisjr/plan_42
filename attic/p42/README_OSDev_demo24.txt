 *** README -  OSDev - demo24 *** 

 This is the code from part 24 of the excellent OS Dev 
series on the brokenthorn.com website here - 
http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html 

As mentioned at the bottom of the above page, the code is 
"public domain", so "share and enjoy....."  :)  

Very many thanks to Mike and the Brokenthorn team for those 
great tutorials!  

It is almost certain that the further development of Plan 42 will 
use this code. It may (however) be changed from C++ to C as that 
is my preferred language. 

*** UPDATE - 10th May 2014 *** 
The first thing I want to do is to see if it is possible 
to modify the OSDEV demo keyboard code to make it more 
"Plan 9"-like. 
** Any help or tips on that are VERY welcome! **
