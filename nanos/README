 ***  Readme -   Nanos  ***  

 Nanos is a small multitasking microkernel operating system 
originally written by Peter Hultqvist.  

 It is planned that Nanos will be used as the base of the Plan 42 
operating system.  

  *** Acknowledgement and Thanks ***  
 Peter has very kindly and generously agreed that I may take over the 
development of Nanos.  He has also very kindly agreed that the Nanos 
code may be released as "public domain".  

 Very many thanks for your kindness and generosity, Peter!
