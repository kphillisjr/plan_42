This is only ideas
	These files are my personal notes for Nanos.
	That means what you'll might find here is in no way fixed.
	So if your read something here which you don´t agree to don´t hesitate to send a mail.


- First step
	Get a running kernel.
	No safety,only simple service
	Evaluation of ideas(keep, change, remove?)

- Second step
	Full implementation of already known ideas

- Third step
	New ideas
