The Nanos register

OR IPC(Inter Process Communication) mechanism

The glue between the driver code and the code using it.

Different modes:

Mode 1:	Direct
Code -> Kernel: get service pointer
Code -> Service: Hello

Mode 2: Indirect
Code -> Kernel: hello service
Kernel -> Service: from code: hello

Mode 3: Message Queue
Code -> Kernel
Kernel -> Queue
...
Kernel(from Queue) -> Service


Mode 1 once initiated is faster.
Mode 2 is safer if the service is removed
Mode 3 - no, to advanced, services can have their own queues
