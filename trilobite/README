Trilobite will be a public-domain implementation of Plan 9's 
Fossil file-system.  

Initially, this is likely to be done in Python, so it will be very much a 
"toy implementation" to start with.  However, a C++ version is 
planned.  This is likely to first be an "embedded" 
filesystem, in a similar manner to "whefs" which is an existing 
public-domain embedded filesystem.  

See the following link for more info on whefs -
