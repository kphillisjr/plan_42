Acknowledgements -  This code would not have been possible if it were not 
for the **excellent** port of 9p to Python done by Tom Newsham.  
Thanks very much, Tom!   

This is a public-domain implementation of 9p in C++.  
This code is a direct port of Tom Newsham's Python implementation.  

Still ultra-ultra-mega-pre-alpha......
