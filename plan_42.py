#  Have you been looking for a public domain operating system? 
#  The perfect public domain OS? One which treats everything as a file? 

#  Well, your search will have to go on for a bit longer. In the 
#  meantime though, you can play with Plan 42.....  ;)    

#  This code is released to the publ;ic domain.  

#  This code requires Teagit.  

#  Notes to self - commands to star with - plumb, cat, 
#  namespace, ......
#  Also do kernel services.  

#  Teagit will be the toy "file system".
