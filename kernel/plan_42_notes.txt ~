  ***  Notes on design of plan 42 ***  

 *  Bootloader -  Use the one from Nanos.  Possibly simplify it.  
May use some code from the "PC assembly" tutorial too.  

*  Kernel -  Mostly from Nanos.  Some code from "PC assembly" tutorial.  
Also look at ideas from XomB "bare bones".   

*  Memory manager  -  To be decided 

*  Virtual filesystem - To be decided.  "PC assembly" tutorial code is very good.  

 *** Overall approach ***  

 Modular.  Simplicity, elegance and modularity are the key aims. 
 Speed is secondary.  

 Might even look at doing a useful mini-Grub-like boot-manager first. This could 
be a useful intro and warmup to things.  For example -  (let's call the boot-manager 
"pdboot )   )  -   

*  pdboot bootloader starts and loads "second stage" pdboot -  
*  Second-stage pdboot brings up menu with selection options.  After that, the plan 42 
kernel could start.  

*  Security.  Think about how to handle this.  Will definitely use permissions as in *nix, 
Plan 9.  Might use other things as well.
