Have you been looking for a public domain operating system? 
The perfect public domain OS? One which treats everything as a file? 

Well, your search will have to go on for a bit longer. In the 
meantime though, you can play with Plan 42.....  ;)    

The Plan 42 code is released to the public domain.  

              ********************************* 

In the future, Plan 42 may use Teagit as the basis of its toy "file system".  
For now, however, it's all about having fun.....
