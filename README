 A start has been made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system. 

 For a long time, I've seen the Plan 9 OS as being almost the 
ideal operating system - very cleanly and elegantly designed. 
A number of things in particular appeal to me about Plan 9 - 

* Its use of the "everything is a file" approach 

* Its use of namespaces throughout the system 

* The very clean approach of its keyboard management 

* The very clean design of its graphics, screen and window 
  management. 


With Plan 42, the aim is to get close to how Plan 9 approaches things
in three main areas -  
*  Keyboard management
*  The use of namespaces throughout the system 
*  The graphics/screen/window areas.  

This may eventually extend to including "plumbing" but the above three areas 
are the main priority at present.  

Plan 42 will differ from Plan 9 in one major respect - 
Plan 42 will NOT make use of a three-button mouse. 
I am a big fan of using the keyboard. The hugely mouse-focused approach of 
the Plan 9 interface will not be part of Plan 42.   


*** STATUS - 13th Nov 2014 *** 

Plan 42 is back in *active* development!  
 
*** Current focus *** 
Creating makefiles to replace the MS Project files. 
This is going well. I'm aiming to have these done by about 27th Nov - 
maybe sooner. 
If these work (and I think they will, given the very good quality of the 
Brokenthorn OS Dev tutorial code that plan42 is now based on) then the 
first working version of plan42 should be out in late November. 
It'll still be *very* basic - just a command-prompt able to accept maybe 
several commands and clear the screen, but it'll be a start.  

 
*** Next up -  *** 
Keyboard (keystroke) management. Scancodes.  
Scancode-to-Unicode mapping using translation tables.

*** ACKNOWLEDGEMENT *** 
Plan 42 is based on the excellent public-domain code from the Brokenthorn OS development tutorial here -

Very many thanks to the team at brokenthorn.com for that outstanding series of articles, and many thanks to them for releasing the code as public-domain!
