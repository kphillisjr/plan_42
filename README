 A start is about to be made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system.

 The first priority is to get a small, simple kernel to boot.  Some P.D. code 
is available to help with this.  After this is done, considerable time will be 
spent becoming familiar with the code and how it works.  

The aim is to first get a very good understanding of the basics of booting, 
kernels and operating systems.  At that point, it should be possible to 
start customising the kernel to become more "Plan 9-like".
