 A start has been made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system. 


*** ACKNOWLEDGEMENT *** 
Plan 42 is based on the excellent public-domain code from the Brokenthorn OS development tutorial here - 
http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html  
 
Very many thanks to the team at brokenthorn.com for that outstanding series of articles, and many thanks to them for releasing the code as public-domain!  



*** STATUS - 20th Dec 2015 *** 

Plan 42 is still in active (slow but steady) development.  

I've now done makefiles for Stage1 and Stage2 of Demo 1 of the 
Brokenthorn series. 
Both makefiles (Stage 1 and Stage 2) now give floppy images 
that *do* boot. Qemu gives the "booting from floppy" message for 
both.  

Stage 1 and Stage 2 directories also have a "makefile2" in them. 
(This is for my own reference really). That makefile works for 
me as well as the other one does.
