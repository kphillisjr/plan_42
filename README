Have you been looking for a public domain operating system? 
The perfect public domain OS? One which treats everything as a file? 

Well, your search will have to go on for a bit longer. In the 
meantime though, you can play with Plan 42.....  ;)    

The Plan 42 code is released to the public domain.  

              ********************************* 

Plan 42 uses Teagit as the basis of its toy "file system".  
It also implements a simple toy shell which tries to be 
similar to the public domain "es" shell.    

( Notes to self - things to start with - plumb, cat, 
namespaces, ......  The plumber and namespaces will 
be very high priority.  Also do kernel services.  )
