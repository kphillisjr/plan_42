Plan 42 is dead.  


I now realise that I "bit off more than I could chew" when 
getting into OS development.  

It would have been good to have been able to have a small 
public-domain OS that had some similarities with Plan 9. 
The 9p protocol, the way that Plan 9 handles keyboards - 
there are lots of things that Plan 9 does really well.  

For now, the repo will stay up but this is unlikely to be
the case for long.
