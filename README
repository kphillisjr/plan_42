 A start has been made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system. 


*** ACKNOWLEDGEMENT *** 
Plan 42 is based on the excellent public-domain code from the Brokenthorn OS development tutorial here - 
http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html  
 
Very many thanks to the team at brokenthorn.com for that outstanding series of articles, and many thanks to them for releasing the code as public-domain!  



*** STATUS - 18th Dec 2015 *** 

Plan 42 is still in active (slow but steady) development.  

I've now done makefiles for Stage1 and Stage2 of Demo 1 of the 
Brokenthorn series. These makefiles do seem to work but the 
resulting disk image does *not* yet boot. I'm looking at how 
to fix this.
