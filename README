 A start has been made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system. 

 For a long time, I've seen the Plan 9 OS as being almost the 
ideal operating system - very cleanly and elegantly designed. 
A number of things in particular appeal to me about Plan 9 - 

* Its use of the "everything is a file" approach 

* Its use of namespaces throughout the system 

* The very clean approach of its keyboard management 

* The very clean design of its graphics, screen and window 
  management. 


With Plan 42, the aim is to get as close as possible to how 
Plan 9 approaches things. In particular, the keyboard management, the namespaces and the graphics/screen/window areas.  


*** STATUS - 11th May 2014 *** 
Plan 42 is back in (relatively) active development. 
*Not* fast development by any means, but I'm keen to get into the keyboard management side of things.  

*** Current focus *** 
* Keyboard (keystroke) management. Scancodes, runes, the scancode-to-Unicode mapping using translation tables.

*** ACKNOWLEDGEMENT *** 
Plan 42 is based on the excellent public-domain code from the Brokenthorn OS development tutorial here -

Very many thanks to the team at brokenthorn.com for that outstanding series of articles, and many thanks to them for releasing the code as public-domain!
