 A start has been made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system.

The first priority is to get a small, simple kernel to boot.  
Some P.D. code is available to help with this.  After this 
is done, considerable time will be spent becoming familiar 
with the code and how it works.  

The aim is to first get a very good understanding of the 
basics of booting, kernels and operating systems.  
At that point, it should be possible to start customising 
the kernel to become more "Plan 9-like".  

*** Update - 7th Jan 2011 *** 
I've added code for the BIOS parameter block and am 
about to start on the stage 2 bootloader.  
I'm also considering whether to write the kernel in C or 
in the public-domain assembly language HLA.  
HLA has a very comprehensive set of libraries, so it has 
a lot going for it.  The syntax is also easy to understand.
