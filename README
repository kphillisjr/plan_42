 A start is about to be made on Plan 42 - a small public-domain 
operating system.

The first priority is to get a small, simple kernel to boot.  
Some P.D. code is available to help with this.  After this 
is done, considerable time will be spent becoming familiar 
with the code and how it works.  

The aim is to first get a very good understanding of the 
basics of booting, kernels and operating systems.  
At that point, it should be possible to start customising 
the kernel to become more "Plan 9-like".  

*** Update - 29th Oct 2010 *** 
I've just found two public-domain operating systems - 
SNAFU and Djehuty. 
Snafu is written in assembly language, and Djehuty in D!  
 
Snafu home page - 
http://home.swipnet.se/smaffy/snafu/ 

Djehuty home page - 
http://github.com/wilkie/djehuty 

Both of these should be excellent resources and very 
useful for the development of plan42! Many thanks to 
these developers!
